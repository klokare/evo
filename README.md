====

**evo** is neuroevolution framework based upon Dr. Kenneth Stanley's [NEAT](https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html) and subsequent extensions. Built from the ground up from the research papers and online articles, this implementation strives to be performant and extensible. See [the wiki](https://github.com/klokare/evo/wiki) for more details.

> NOTE: This is the second incarnation of EVO. Having survived the growing pains of the original, I decided to update the library based on my experience and continued reading. The prior version is archived under the archive-20180109 branch.

## Installing
To start using EVO, install Go and run `go get`:

```sh
$ go get github.com/klokare/evo/...
```

For further information on using, see the examples and peruse [the wiki](https://github.com/klokare/evo/wiki).
